                                          /*OBERVIEW OF SIMPLE CALCULATOR*/

Creating a simple calculator in C++ involves implementing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling:** Uses `std::cin` to get input from the user. Input format is assumed to be `number operator number`.
- **Switch Statement:** Determines which arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator entered.
- **Error Handling:** Checks for division by zero and invalid operators.

### Improvements:
- **Floating Point Precision:** Handle floating point operations more robustly.
- **Multiple Operations:** Extend the calculator to handle more complex expressions with multiple operations.
- **User Interface:** Enhance user experience with a more interactive interface.

This simple calculator provides a basic framework that you can expand upon depending on your needs and requirements.
